# üéØ What‚Äôs Next in Your TypeScript Practice

You‚Äôve completed the course ‚Äî now it‚Äôs about turning knowledge into engineering impact.
Here‚Äôs how to build on what you‚Äôve learned inside the BBC codebase and beyond.

---

## üöÄ The Next Two Weeks ‚Äî Consolidate and Apply

### 1. **Apply It in Real Code**

* Refactor a **component, service, or utility** from `any` to strong types.
* Add **strict mode** to one repo and fix the resulting errors methodically.
* Pair with a colleague to review **type design**, not just runtime behaviour.

### 2. **Reflect and Document**

* Capture one *before/after* example of improved safety or clarity from your own code.
* Add a short **developer note or ADR** explaining a typing decision (e.g. `satisfies`, discriminated unions).

### 3. **Share Knowledge**

* Post one internal message on what you‚Äôve learned ‚Äî Slack, Teams, or a short demo.
* Offer a 15-minute ‚ÄúType Tip‚Äù in your next team meeting.

## üìö Deepening Expertise ‚Äî Over the Next Month

### **Key Technical Areas**

| Focus                        | Why It Matters at the BBC                                                    |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Type-Safe APIs**           | Most systems exchange JSON; infer types from OpenAPI or GraphQL schemas.     |
| **Type Inference Mastery**   | Reduce duplication in shared libraries and test suites.                      |
| **Refining Types for React** | Improve component props, context, and custom hooks typing.                   |
| **Toolchain Understanding**  | How `tsc`, `vite`, or `webpack` integrate with BBC build and test pipelines. |

### **Practice Projects**

* Create a **type-safe data model** for one existing REST API.
* Write a **utility type** that replaces a common runtime check in your code.
* Explore **Zod** or **io-ts** for runtime schema validation.

## üß≠ The Next Quarter ‚Äî Professional Maturity

### **Architectural Typing**

* Use **mapped + conditional types** to model domain rules (permissions, editorial states, etc.).
* Design **internal type libraries** ‚Äî shared utilities for your team‚Äôs services.
* Evaluate **monorepo patterns** (`tsconfig.paths`, project references, build isolation).

### **Testing & Tooling**

* Add **type tests** (e.g. `expect-type`, `tsd`) for public utilities.
* Strengthen **linting and pre-commit** checks with `@typescript-eslint`.
* Use **type-driven TDD**: write the types before you write the code.

---

## üß© Integrate with BBC Workflows

* Align types across **frontend and backend contracts** using shared schema generation.
* Review how **Playwright** or **Jest** tests can infer types automatically.
* Ensure new projects start with a **minimal strict `tsconfig.json`** template.
* Help maintain **internal TypeScript guidelines** ‚Äî idioms, naming, file structure.

## ü§ù Contribute and Lead

* Review PRs for **type clarity and correctness**, not just logic.
* Open internal tickets where **types can express intent** more clearly.
* Share snippets or patterns that reduce duplication across teams.
* Consider contributing type definitions to **DefinitelyTyped** or BBC open-source repos.

## üß≠ Milestones

| Stage                      | Evidence of Growth                                                       |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Confident Practitioner** | You design and refactor types without breaking builds.                   |
| **Team Resource**          | Colleagues ask you to sanity-check their type decisions.                 |
| **TypeScript Advocate**    | You help set team standards, introduce new TS tooling, or mentor others. |

## ‚ú® Final Thought

TypeScript isn‚Äôt just about correctness ‚Äî it‚Äôs about **communication**.
Strong types make intent explicit, accelerate onboarding, and prevent hidden coupling.
Keep typing the boundaries, simplifying the internals, and sharing what you learn.

**Next week, pick one place in BBC code that hurts to refactor ‚Äî and make it type-safe.**
That‚Äôs how you keep levelling up.
